# DictionaryAttack
A simple Java application for dictionary SHA attack

This java application is a brute-force technique where red hate attackers could run through common words and phrases, such as those from their own dictionary, to crack and guess the passwords.  Commonly used password lists such as popular names, pet names, movie or television characters, and other words can all be part of a dictionary list. The input would be a JSON file in the format of <Username/name>:<Hashed passwords>. The selected dictionary file would be a TXT file with every phrase or word arranged line by line. The application provides 3 types of SHA algorithms: SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA512.

## Getting Started
1. Download the application
2. Upload hashed password (JSON file)
3. Upload Dictionary (TXT file)
4. Select the type of SHA algorithm 
5. Execute and wait for result
